It's not easy to graph complex functions (since such a graph would have 4 real dimensions), but the image of a complex functions can be visualized quite beautifully.
Each point on the plane can be coloured with a hue corresponding to the argument of the image of that point. 
In the case of conformal maps, it is also interesting to look at the image of a rectangular grid.

<h2> The Cayley Map </h2>
Some visualizations of the Cayley map and its inverse. 
The gaps are the images of a neighbourhood of infinity.
