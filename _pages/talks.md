<b>Title:</b> The Beauty of the Hyperbolic Plane

<b>Abstract:</b> The beauty of hyperbolic geometry has inspired the work of artists and mathematicians alike, most famously that of M. C. Escher. This talk will provide an illustrated introduction to the hyperbolic plane and its isometries. We will begin by first investigating the tilings of the Euclidean plane, and then expand our horizons to tilings of the hyperbolic plane. With the aid of concrete examples and pictures, we will explore how groups of isometries act on hyperbolic space and when these groups produce tilings and other highly symmetric patterns. Along the way, we also provide an introduction to Mobius maps, Fuchsian groups and hyperbolic surfaces.
