<b>Title:</b> The Length of the Shortest Closed Geodesic on a Surface of Finite Area.
<br>
<b>Abstract:</b> Every complete surface of finite area admits at least one closed (periodic) geodesic. It is natural to ask how long these curves can be relative to the surface's total area, and it is easiest to consider the length of a (possibly non-unique) shortest geodesic. One approach is to utilize the Birkhoff curve shortening process. However, the non-compact case presents a challenge, as a given curve may escape to infinity under the curve shortening process instead of converging to a geodesic. In this talk, we present joint work with Regina Rotman on this problem that builds upon the results of Christopher Croke.

<h3>CUMC 2019</h3>

<b>Title:</b> The Beauty of the Hyperbolic Plane
<br>
<b>Abstract:</b> The beauty of hyperbolic geometry has inspired the work of artists and mathematicians alike, most famously that of M. C. Escher. This talk will provide an illustrated introduction to the hyperbolic plane and its isometries. We will begin by first investigating the tilings of the Euclidean plane, and then expand our horizons to tilings of the hyperbolic plane. With the aid of concrete examples and pictures, we will explore how groups of isometries act on hyperbolic space and when these groups produce tilings and other highly symmetric patterns. Along the way, we also provide an introduction to Mobius maps, Fuchsian groups and hyperbolic surfaces.
