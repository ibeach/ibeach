<h3>Explanation: </h3> 
These are images of "pursuit curves". Each curve is the trajectory of some "pursuer", which chases one of the other pursuers. The simplest example is the "mice problem"-- $n$ pursuers (or mice) are initially placed at the vertices of a regular polygon, and they proceed to chase the neighbour to their left.

In these examples, there are $n$ pursuers, and each pursuer chases the pursuer that lies $k+1$ places counter-clockwise from them. At each time step, lines are drawn between each pursuer and its prey.
