<b>About Me:</b> I am a fifth-year undergraduate in the Math Specialist program at the University of Toronto.
My main research interest is low dimensional geometry.

<p>

This site is primarily a repository for all the pretty mathematical images I make for fun.
You can check out some of my creations and personal projects via the links in the sidebar (or hit "Toggle Menu" on mobile).
Be warned that almost all pages are extremely image-heavy! 

<p>

<b>Usage:</b> Every image on this website has been made by me unless otherwise noted. 
You are free to use them for any non-commercial purpose as long as you credit me by name (if possible).

<b>Disclaimer:</b> None of the code available on this website is claimed to work correctly or optimally. It is provided only to help explain the accompanying images. 
Don't run code if you don't understand what it does!
